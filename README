# Teensy Electronic leadscrew
This is an implementation of an electronic leadscrew using a Teensy microcrontroller.

# Architecture
We use [https://platformio.org/](platformio) as the infrastructure to build this project.

# Installation
You will currently need to setup platformio to build this, it can also handle installation to your teensy as well.
NOTE: you will have to modify some of the configuration to get this set up for your particular lathe, instructions coming soon.

# Testing
We aim to have the business logic of this testable locally without having to program any hardware or run tests on hardware (for the most part)
To test you just need to run the `pio test --environment native` command to run what tests we have written
